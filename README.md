# Detecting-Defects-in-Software-Requirements-Specificatons-Tool
This tool is made using Python.
It's used for detecting defects in software requirements specifications written by the user.

The tool uses a dataset containing the words that shouldn't be used in a requirement or else it would be considered a bad software requirement.
The dataset also classifies the type of the defects belonging to each word.
There are three types included in the dataset which are: Ambiguity, Weak word and Unbounded lists.
You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/norasami/defects-in-software-requirements

The tool is deployed using Streamlit.
